3D Ising Model Monte Carlo Simulation

This project simulates the 3D Ising model using the Monte Carlo method. The Ising model is a fundamental model in statistical mechanics, which helps understand phase transitions, such as ferromagnetism. In this simulation, a grid of "spins" (either +1 or -1) is initialized and iteratively updated. The Monte Carlo method is used to simulate thermal fluctuations by flipping spins based on a probability that depends on the energy change and temperature. The program outputs various physical quantities such as energy, magnetization, heat capacity, and susceptibility.
